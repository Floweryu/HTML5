      <h1>Rip Van winkle</h1>
      <p>Many years ago, at the foothills of the Kaatskill (Kat-skill) mountains,
           was a little village. In the village lived a simple, good-natured fellow 
           named Rip Van Winkle. He was a kind neighbour, ready to help anyone. </p>

      <h1>Robinson Crusoe</h1>
      <p>As Rip and his companion reached them, they stopped playing and stared at 
          Rip with a fixed gaze. Rip was really frightened. His companion emptied the 
          contents of the barrel into glasses and made Rip drink it.</p>
